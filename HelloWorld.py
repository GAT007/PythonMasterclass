# Print is a function
# The literal hello world is called an argument.
# Here Hello World is an argument to the print function

print("Hello World!")

# We can also print out the results of calculations
# For example
print(1 + 2)
print(7 * 6)
print()

# Python prints out the results as 3, 42 and the blank line is left as a blank
# The print function has been built in such a way it can take multiple arguments

print("The end", "Or is it?", "keep watching to learn more about Python", 3, "!")
